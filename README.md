# Kali's Whiteboard
Kali's minimalist whiteboard site for streams and other doodles. Adds a subtle movement so information doesn't feel so static.

One second after the drawing menu is closed, the canvas goes into "wiggle mode" which rerenders every stroke with each point at a random positions varied by a single pixel in the x, y, or both axis.
Wiggle mode stops when a brush stroke happens or when the drawing menu is opened.

You can clear the entire canvas and save it as a static image.
There are four brush stroke widths.
The color palette is based on our personal preference of colors and no colors will be added.
You can undo and redo using the z and x buttons, respectively.
